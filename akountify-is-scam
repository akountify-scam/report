Scam Alert: Akountify (.ai, .net, .com), Obelisk Ventures, and Overlead Credit Card Charges — What You Must Know

If you're searching for terms like "Obelisk Ventures scam", "Overlead credit card charge fraud", or "Is Akountify.com legit?" — this report will expose the truth behind these connected operations.

🔍 The Scam Network Explained
What looks like a professional tech ecosystem is actually a sophisticated international scam operating in the gray area of online commerce. Here's how they present themselves:

Obelisk Ventures (obeliskventures.com) – Portrays itself as a legitimate tech venture or SaaS partner.
Overlead – Marketed as a sales engagement platform. In reality, it’s the name that appears on credit card charges from Akountify purchases.
Akountify – Offers LinkedIn outreach solutions for outbound teams under multiple domains: Akountify.com, Akountify.net, and Akountify.ai.

Despite the slick branding and polished websites, victims report a shared experience: they never receive what they paid for, are misled by support, and are eventually ghosted or insulted.

🧾 Overlead on Your Bank Statement? It’s Part of the Scam
Customers who make purchases through Akountify are surprised to find Overlead or Obelisk Ventures listed as the merchant on their card statement. 
This clever tactic makes it difficult to trace the charge or file a dispute. Contact information associated with these charges includes:

📧 manuel@obeliskventures.com
📞 +34 829 383 8871
💳 Charge description: OVERLEAD / OBELISKVENTURES.COM

This tactic adds confusion and weakens your position in filing chargebacks. Overlead is not a platform you signed up for—but it’s how the scam hides.

🌐 Akountify.com, Akountify.net, Akountify.ai – Many Domains, One Scam
Akountify uses multiple domain names to create a web of confusion and maintain the appearance of a scalable SaaS solution. Victims report:

Being guided into Slack for fake onboarding
Facing delays, scripted excuses, or hostile responses
Receiving no service or product after payment
Refunds blocked or ignored

This cross-domain strategy makes it harder to track complaints across platforms, helping them avoid detection.

💬 Trustpilot Reviews Are Manipulated – Here’s the Reality
Akountify and its affiliates maintain an artificially positive reputation by stuffing Trustpilot and other review platforms with fake 5-star ratings. Don’t be fooled by the top scores.
They will often attempt to counter complaints from victims by accusing them of using fake identities or violating terms—ironically, this comes from the very people selling fake accounts. Yes, the same operation scamming people with fake LinkedIn accounts is also blaming victims for using them.
Just look at their Trustpilot page: they intentionally flood it with glowing reviews. But if you filter by 1-star reviews, you’ll see the truth — dozens of victims sharing detailed stories of how they were deceived.

🌍 Obelisk Ventures & Co. – Fraud Operation Possibly Based in Spain
Evidence points to this scheme operating out of Spain, using real merchant processors, branded interfaces, and legal-sounding paperwork to mask fraud. Victims describe:

Professional-looking invoices
Branded Slack channels
False promises of LinkedIn accounts or outreach services

All of which appear legitimate, until the service stops—or never begins.
