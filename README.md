Akountify is a SCAM! Beware! Avoid doing business with them!
SCAM WARNING: The Hidden Fraud Network Behind Obelisk Ventures, Overlead, and Akountify
If you’re researching Obelisk Ventures (obeliskventures.com), wondering why your credit card shows a charge from Overlead, or looking into whether Akountify.com, Akountify.net, or Akountify.ai is legit — read this first.

🔎 Overview of the Operation
At first glance, all these companies appear professional and legitimate:

Obelisk Ventures presents itself as a startup or tech venture firm.
Overlead claims to be a sales engagement platform.
Akountify markets itself as a LinkedIn outreach solution for outbound sales teams.

But in reality, these entities are linked in a highly deceptive grey-area scam designed to mislead, defraud, and manipulate customers globally — especially those in the digital marketing, SaaS, and startup space.

🧾 Overlead Credit Card Charges – What You Need to Know
Many victims report being charged under the name “Overlead” after purchasing services from Akountify, despite never receiving what was promised. These charges are processed by Obelisk Ventures, whose representative is associated with:

📧 manuel@obeliskventures.com
📞 Phone: +34 829 383 8871
💳 Charges appear as: OVERLEAD / OBELISKVENTURES.COM

This setup is intentionally confusing, making it harder for victims to file chargebacks or connect the dots.

🌐 Akountify.com, Akountify.net, Akountify.ai – Multiple Domains, Same Scam
Akountify operates across multiple domains, including:

🔹 Akountify.com
🔹 Akountify.net
🔹 Akountify.ai

While each site appears slick and professional, customers report the same experience: after payment, they are pushed into Slack for “onboarding,” only to experience delays, rudeness, and eventually—nothing delivered. Refunds are deliberately obstructed, and complaints are met with hostility.

💬 Fake Reviews and Reputation Manipulation
Akountify and its connected entities maintain a falsely positive reputation by flooding Trustpilot and other review platforms with fake 5-star ratings. However, a quick Google search for:

“Akountify scam”
“Akountify linkedin scam”
“Overlead credit card charge scam”
“Akountify reviews”

…will reveal the truth: dozens of real customer complaints, refund disputes, and reports of suspicious or fraudulent behavior.

🌍 Operated from Spain, Scamming Globally
Evidence suggests that this entire operation is based in Spain, with a network designed to appear legal while scamming victims in a sophisticated, hard-to-trace manner. They operate in a “grey area” of fraud, making use of:

Legitimate-looking invoices
Branded Slack workspaces
Real payment processors

Yet in the end, the customer is left with nothing.

⚠️ Final Warning: Avoid Obelisk Ventures, Overlead & Akountify
If you're considering working with any of the following:

Obelisk Ventures (obeliskventures.com)
Overlead (as seen on your credit card statement)
Akountify.com / Akountify.net / Akountify.ai

Stop immediately. This is not a real service. This is a sophisticated scam operation.

📢 Help spread the word. Report your experience. And protect others from falling into the same trap.
